<div id="bioTxt">
	<p>Howard Seth Miller was born in New York City, and is known for his provocative van dyke, or split-toned silver-gelatin black-and-white photographs.   Using his favorite equipment, a 5 x 7 view camera, fitted with an old-fashioned portrait lens, he creates intricate narratives and self-revelatory visual riddles on the themes of childhood, adolescence and adult male psychology.</p>
<p>He has had solo exhibitions at Nassau County Museum of Fine Art, Roslyn, NY; Morlen Sinoway, Chicago, IL; and Harbor Front Gallery, Toronto, Canada.  His work was included in group exhibitions in New York City - Ricco-Maresca Gallery, Nerlino Gallery, and 55 Mercer; and University Art Museum, University of California, Berkeley, CA.</p>
<p>Monographs include Photographs of Children, published by Nassau County Museum of Fine Art, Roslyn, NY; and School, a compilation of the artist&rsquo;s photographs and writings.  His photograph, Tuesday is Tuesday, from his &lsquo;School Series&rsquo; was published as a black-and-white postcard by Fotofolio, NYC.</p>
<p>He received an M.F.A. from The School of The Art Institute of Chicago, IL, and was awarded the Foundation for the Arts College Scholarship.  He resides in Santa Cruz County, California.</p>
