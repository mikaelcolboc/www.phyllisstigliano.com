His work was first shown at Poindexter Gallery, NYC, in the exhibition, Second Annual New Talent Festival, 1974; his work has appeared in numerous solo and group shows including Veiled Actions, EB Fine Art Curatorium, Hudson, NY, 2015; Transparent Things: Recent Paintings, Phyllis Stigliano Gallery, Brooklyn, NY, 2009; Union County College, Cranford, NJ; Luise Ross Gallery, NYC, 1986 and 1987; Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY; Arkansas Arts Center, Little Rock, AK; and Queens Museum, Flushing, NY. His work is in collections including Asheville Art Museum, Asheville, NC, and EB Fine Art Foundation Collection, Hudson, NY.</p>
