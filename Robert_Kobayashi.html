	Robert (Kobi) Kobayashi (b. 1925 Honolulu, Territory of HI; d. 2015 Honolulu, HI) began his career as an abstract expressionist painter during the late 1940's-early 1960's, then he became known for paintings and three-dimensional work using exquisitely sheared and nailed/tattooed pieces of tin. His metal paintings and sculpture, empowered by bold colors, depict intriguing still-lifes and figures that reveal a sophisticated vision and an innovative spirit.
</p>
<p>
	Encouraged by his sister Fumi to pursue art, after serving in WWII, under the GI Bill he studied at Honolulu Academy of Arts with Wilson Stamper 1946-1948; Paris 1950; and Brooklyn Museum Art School, NY, with John Ferren 1949-1951. He was hired by The Museum of Modern Art to care for <em>Japanese House</em> that was re-installed in the museum's garden for an architectural exhibition 1954-1955; with brief intervals, he continued to work at MoMA until 1978. He received a fellowship from the John Hay Whitney Foundation, NY; and he was a founding member of Brata Gallery 1957 - one of the Tenth Street Galleries, NYC. In 1991, he wrote and illustrated a children's book, Maria Mazaretti Loves Spaghetti, for the publisher Alfred A. Knopf, NY.
