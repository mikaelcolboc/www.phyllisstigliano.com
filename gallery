						<p>The mission of the gallery is to present unique aesthetic experiences to the viewing public.  Selecting innovative artists, the gallery's purpose is to heighten the awareness of fine art, and to foster an understanding of diverse works of art including folk, image and abstract work, photography, and special installations.</p>
<p>Phyllis Stigliano opened her contemporary gallery in Park Slope/Brooklyn, New York, May 2004.</p>
<p>She has featured exhibitions including, <i>Mary Whitfield, Lynchings: remember each of them; Robert Kobayashi: Tin; John Himmelfarb, The Borrower's Name: card catalog drawings; and Wake: A memorial to the US troops and Iraqis who have died in Iraq over the past year</i>, an installation of black-and-white laser printed photographs by Carrie Iverson.Community-minded, the latter two exhibitions traveled to the Brooklyn Public Library, Grand Army Plaza.</p>
<p>A former curator of the Nassau County Museum of Fine Art, Roslyn, New York, she originated numerous exhibitions.  With an emphasis on outdoor site-specific sculpture, she worked with American sculptors Michael Heizer, Mark de Suvero, Richard Serra, Richard Nonas, and Allen Bertoldi.  As a consultant to the African-American Museum, Hempstead, New York, she first noticed the work of self-taught artist Mary Whitfield and continues to represent and present her art of the slavery epoch of American history; and she did primary research on outsider artist Bill Traylor published in a monograph by Luise Ross Gallery, New York.  She worked with Ray Johnson on independent projects including the Venice Biennale; artist book; and exhibition, <i>More Works by Ray Johnson 1951-1991</i>, at Goldie Paley Gallery-Moore College of Art and Design, Philadelphia. </p>
<p>As an archivist for Niki de Saint Phalle in Paris, France, her work was published in a monograph - one of five inaugural exhibitions at the Kunst-und-Ausstellungshalle, Bonn, Germany; and assisted Pontus Hulten with the organization of research on sculptor Jean Tinguely under the Niki archives.</p>
<p>From 2000-2017, along with Kate Keller, she was co-principal of Moe's Meat Market, a gallery, located in Nolita, 237 Elizabeth Street, New York City, that featured the work of Robert Kobayashi.</p>
