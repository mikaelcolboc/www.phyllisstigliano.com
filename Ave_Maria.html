<div id="bioTxt">
		<p>Ave Maria was born in Buffalo, New York, and is known as a master printmaker who specializes in landscapes that evoke moods and experiences of time.  Using the color application of &agrave; la poup&eacute;e, her images are realized with force and lucidity depicting scenes of known locales &ndash; inspired by places where she and her husband have lived or visited.  Remote forests, lush creeks, moonlit woods, sinuous mountain tops &ndash; these are images of somewhere &ndash; a perceived visible reality.  The works, whether etchings or paintings, are contemplative, brilliant moments of the artist&rsquo;s visual memories.</p>
<p>Her work is in numerous permanent collections in New Jersey including Ayerst Laboratories, Bell Labs, Monmouth University, Monmouth County Park System, and Ocean County College.</p>
<p>She received an B.F.A. in Printmaking at Daemen College, Buffalo, New York; and an M.A. in studio art education at Kean University, Union, New Jersey. </p>
