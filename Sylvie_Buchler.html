	The figurative oil and acrylic paintings of Sylvie Buchler are committed to a passion in depicting the body in a manner that blends realism with abstraction. Buchler’s subjects are known to her; she captures an intense emotion with a quickened resolve and expressionist spirit. Best known for her portraits, her process of wandering through each person’s existence evokes a transparent sincerity.
